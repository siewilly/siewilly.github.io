👋 About Me
Hi there! I'm a 16-year-old high school student from 🇹🇼 Taiwan (currently in 11th grade).
I enjoy coding 💻 and playing badminton 🏸, and I grow a little every day — one bug at a time!

🔍 Love exploring algorithm structures and practicing problem solving

🧠 Currently diving into CTFs (still a newbie, but improving!)

⚫ Go (Weiqi) is my one and only king

🚀 Short-Term Goals
🐍 Master Python inside and out

🌐 Build my own website using templates

📚 Share all my problem-solving writeups on GitHub (ongoing ✅)

📖 My Learning Journey
I started with Python, just for fun — but somehow, I got better and better 🛠️
Recently, I’ve been exploring frontend development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

🎯 Goals
💼 Get into the Taiwan Olympiad in Informatics (TOI) training camp

🏆 Qualify for the national-level programming competition

🧪 Understand CTF challenges (at least read the problems 🤯)

📁 Upload and share all my problem-solving work

🎓 Get into NCTU CS (National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University)

🪪 Earn a spot at AIS3

💡 My Attitude Toward Coding
“I chose this path myself. No matter how hard it gets or how many bugs I face — I’ll always find a way to solve them.”

I believe every bug is a stepping stone. That’s why I code — not for perfection, but for progress 🚀
