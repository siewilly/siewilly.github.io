# From Algorithms to My Own Website (~~I Used a Template www~~)

Recently, I started exploring cybersecurity, and I suddenly met an incredibly skilled friend. He showed me [his awesome website](https://itousouta15.github.io/), and I was immediately amazed. I couldn’t help but ask him for help, and with his guidance, I successfully built my **first website**! 🚀

# Preparing Hexo & Its Features

## Features of Hexo ✨

During the process of being guided by this tech wizard, I gradually realized a few things:

- **Markdown**: While I was writing the [About page](https://siewilly.github.io/about/), I discovered Hexo's first big advantage — Markdown is one of the easiest ways to create webpages. For HTML beginners like me, Markdown is super friendly.
- **Template Convenience**: You can make beautiful websites with the simplest writing.
- **Easy to Use**: All you need is Node.js and npm installed (~~perfect for noobs like me~~), and you can start building a site!

## The Template I Used 🧩

With the help of my tech god friend, I customized a theme originally from [D-Sketon](https://d-sketon.github.io/) (big thanks and much respect 🙇‍♂️). His instructions and comments were super clear, which made the whole setup smooth and quick.

# Actual Setup & My Thoughts 💻

## A Tool I Discovered: Visual Studio Code

Before using VS Code, I was coding in Python IDLE (~~my friend said coding directly in the terminal was kind of brave?~~). That made me realize that what I used before wasn’t the best way to code — ~~I was such a noob~~ 😅.

## GitHub Isn’t Just Uploading on the Website?!

I learned that uploading code to GitHub involves commands like:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main
